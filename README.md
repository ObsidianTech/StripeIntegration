# StripeIntegration
A small sample project implementing Stripe's checkout system integrated with ASP.Net Core 2.0. 
The instructions on how to implement are documented here: https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/aspnet .
This project is just a demonstration of how the checkout intgration can run in an ASP.Net Core 2.0 application 
(the original documentation shows 1.0 implementation).
